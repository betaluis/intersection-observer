          <p>See, that wasn’t so difficult! Here are the <em>Leave No Trace Seven Principles</em> by the Center for
            Outdoor Ethics:</p>
          <p>The Seven Principles of Leave No Trace provide an easily understood framework of minimum impact practices
            for anyone visiting the outdoors. Although Leave No Trace has its roots in backcountry settings, the
            Principles have been adapted so that they can be applied anywhere — from remote wilderness areas, to local
            parks and even in your own backyard. They also apply to almost every recreational activity. Each Principle
            covers a specific topic and provides detailed information for minimizing impacts.</p>

          <p>The Seven Principles are well established and widely known, but they are not static. The Leave No Trace
            Center for Outdoor Ethics continually examines, evaluates and reshapes the Principles. The Center’s
            Education Department conducts research — including publishing scholarly articles in independent journals —
            to ensure that the Principles are up to date with the latest insights from biologists, land managers and
            other leaders in outdoor education.</p>
